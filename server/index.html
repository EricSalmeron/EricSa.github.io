              <h3>Pink Floyd, British rock band at the forefront of 1960s psychedelia who later 
                popularized the concept album for mass rock audiences in the 1970s.Formed in 1965, 
                the band went through several name changes before combining the first names of a 
                pair of Carolina bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Their initial direction 
                came from vocalist-guitarist-songwriter Barrett, whose mixture of blues, music hall 
                styles, Lewis Carroll references, and dissonant psychedelia established the band 
                as a cornerstone of the British underground scene. They signed with EMI and early
                 in 1967 had their first British hit with the controversial “Arnold Layne,” a 
                 song about a transvestite. This was followed by their debut album, The Piper 
                 at the Gates of Dawn, a lush, experimental record that has since become a rock 
                 classic.

              Like its associated album, the film is highly metaphorical, 
                    and frequently utilizes both visual and auditory symbols throughout 
                    its runtime. It features little dialogue, instead being driven by the 
                    music from the album throughout.
